# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions to the [2022's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022).
This year I have decided to write my solutions in Rust and to try to write as clean code as possible. The solutions are
way more complicated than they need to be. They are also way more commented than they need to be.
