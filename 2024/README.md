# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions to the [2024's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024).
This year I have decided to write as many solutions as I can in
[my language](https://github.com/viddrobnic/aoc-lang).

## Running

Solution for a day can be run with:

```bash
aoc-lang run day_XX.aoc < input.txt
```

The program expects the problem input to be located at `inputs/day_XX.txt`.
