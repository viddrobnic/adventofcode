# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions to the [2025's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025).
This year I am back to OCaml as my language of choice.

## Running

Solution for a day can be run with:

```bash
dune exec aoc <day>
```

The program expects the problem input to be located at `inputs/dayXX.txt`.
