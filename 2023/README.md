# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions to the [2023's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023).
This year I have decided to write as many solutions as I can in OCaml.

## Running

### OCaml

Solution for a day can be run with:

```bash
dune exec aoc <day>
```

The program expects the problem input to be located at `inputs/day_XX.txt`.

### Go

Solutions in Go are located in the `go` subdirectory. Solution for a day can be run with:

```sh
go run main.go <day>
```

The program expects the problem input to be located at `go/inputs/day_XX.txt`.
